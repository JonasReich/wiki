## Personal Projects on GitHub
I've created a [collection of Unity doodads](https://github.com/JonasReich/unity-doodads), that might be useful for future projects (Editor Enhancements, code snippets, etc).
If you're working with Git, you might also be interested in my [Git Integration plugin](https://github.com/JonasReich/unity-git-integration).

## Tutorials
[_Catlike Coding_](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) is a Patreon funded tutorial/instruction site mostly centered around Unity3D. The page contains great resources for **PBR** and **materials in Unity**.
