# Git

The main version control tool I use. As you can see, most of my spare time projects are hosted on GitHub, which should speak for itself.

## Merge tools

### p4Merge

Originally a mergetool for Perforce, p4Merge can be set up to merge files independently of the source control software used. In contrast to Perforce, p4Merge can be used for free.

There's a download on the [Perforce download page](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/visual-merge-tool)
